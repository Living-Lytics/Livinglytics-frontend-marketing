Add Privacy & Terms pages (with full wording) + routes + footer links

I’m in the living-lytics-marketing (Vite + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui) app.
Create two new pages — Privacy Policy and Terms of Service — with the exact wording below, register routes, and ensure the footer links navigate internally.

1) Create pages with this exact content

File: src/pages/Privacy.tsx

import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function Privacy() {
  useEffect(() => { document.title = "Privacy Policy — Living Lytics"; }, []);
  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-16 px-6 space-y-6 text-gray-300">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-2 text-white">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-400">Last Updated: October 2025</p>

      <section className="space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Living Lytics (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy.
          This policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard the personal information
          of anyone who visits our website, uses our application, or interacts with our services.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in three main ways:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li><b>Account Information:</b> name, email address, and password when you create an account.</li>
          <li><b>Connected Data Sources:</b> if you authorize integrations (e.g., Google Analytics 4, Instagram Business),
              we receive analytical data and metrics from those platforms through their APIs.</li>
          <li><b>Usage Data:</b> log data such as IP address, browser type, device information, and interaction data
              to improve performance and security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our analytics services.</li>
          <li>Personalize the dashboard and automate insights.</li>
          <li>Communicate regarding account activity, feature updates, and security notices.</li>
          <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We apply encryption, access controls, and continuous monitoring to protect your data.
          No method of transmission is completely secure; by using our services, you acknowledge this risk.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform connects with external providers such as Google LLC and Meta Platforms.
          Their data practices are governed by their own privacy policies.
          Living Lytics is not responsible for how third parties process data once shared through authorized integrations.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Access or update account information at any time.</li>
          <li>Disconnect integrated accounts from the <b>Connect</b> page.</li>
          <li>Request deletion of your account by contacting <a href="mailto:support@livinglytics.com" className="text-blue-400">support@livinglytics.com</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain user data only as long as necessary to provide our services or as required by law.
          When you close your account, your personal information and linked data sources are securely deleted
          or anonymized within 30 days.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our services are not directed toward individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect data from minors.
          If you believe a minor has provided personal information, contact us for removal.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">9. Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>
          We may revise this Privacy Policy periodically. Updated versions will appear on this page with a new
          “Last Updated” date. Your continued use of Living Lytics after an update signifies acceptance of the revised policy.
        </p>

File: src/pages/Terms.tsx

import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function Terms() {
  useEffect(() => { document.title = "Terms of Service — Living Lytics"; }, []);
  return (

  );
}

2) Register routes

Locate the app router (e.g., src/App.tsx or src/routes.tsx) and add:

import Privacy from "@/pages/Privacy";
import Terms from "@/pages/Terms";

// Inside your <Routes>:
<Route path="/privacy" element={<Privacy />} />
<Route path="/terms" element={<Terms />} />

3) Wire footer links (internal navigation)

Open the footer component (e.g., src/components/Footer.(tsx|jsx)) and ensure links use the router’s <Link>:

import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

// Replace Privacy/Terms anchors with:
<Link to="/privacy" className="hover:text-white">Privacy</Link>
<Link to="/terms" className="hover:text-white">Terms</Link>

4) Run & verify

Restart dev server if needed: npm run dev

Print the preview URL.

Confirm:

Clicking Privacy goes to /privacy and shows the policy.

Clicking Terms goes to /terms and shows the terms.

Titles update appropriately in the browser tab.

Deliverables

List of created/edited files.

Preview URL.

One-line confirmation that both routes work and footer links navigate correctly.
